<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
1) Download project files.
2) Go to Project->Scripts : Here you will find the Relatives.cs file. You attach this file to the Gameobject that you wish to know it's position and facing with relation to another object.
3) Add a reference in the editor to the object you wish reference or in code.
4)  
To sumarise: Object A gets the Relatives.cs file. You then add an Object B to the reference slot in the Relatives.cs file in the editor. 

## Usage
An example use case can be found in the demo scene where you can see some text describing the relations between object A (main camera in this case) and object B (Suzanne).
